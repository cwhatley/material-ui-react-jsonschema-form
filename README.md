## Installation

TODO: push to NPM

```
npm i material-ui-react-jsonschema-form
```

## Overview

This package exports a Form object that renders using [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) by
default.

Unlike other similar packages, this is, a customization of
[react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form)
rather than a fork or reimplementation of it and
keeping up to date with that project should be quite a bit simpler.

Use of this package should be roughly the same as [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form).

## Playground

Visit the playground at <https://cwhatley.github.io/material-ui-react-jsonschema-form/>

You can launch a playground that has been ported to material-ui via `npm start`.
