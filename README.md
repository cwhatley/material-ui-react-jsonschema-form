## Installation

```
npm i material-ui-react-jsonschema-form
```

## Overview

This package exports a Form object that renders using material-ui by
default.

Unlike other similar packages, this is, a customization of
react-jsonschema-form rather than a fork or reimplementation of it and
keeping up to date with that project should be quite a bit simpler.

Use of this package should be roughly the same as 'mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form'.

## Playground

You can launch a playground that has been ported to material-ui via 'npm start'.
